# Chapter 5: Spending our Data ----
## 5.1 Common Methods for Splitting Data ----



# When data are reused for multiple tasks, instead of carefully 'spent'
# from the finite data budget, certain risks increase, such as the risk of
# accentuating bias or compounding effects from methodological errors

# Allocate data to different tasks, not putting everything into parameter est.

# Primary approach is normally training and test sets: 2 set
# training is the sandbox where exploration, feature engineering, and
    # model fitting happens
